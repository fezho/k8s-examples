```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── cmd        # main application for this project
├── deploy     # kubernetes deploy files, such as Deployment, Service, Role
│   └── install.yaml
├── go.mod     # go module file
├── go.sum     # go module file
└── pkg
```

### Publish docker image to github package
```console
# TOKEN can be generated in https://github.com/settings/tokens
docker login -u USERNAME -p TOKEN docker.pkg.github.com
make image
docker push docker.pkg.github.com/fezho/k8s-examples/kube-xxx-demo:tag
